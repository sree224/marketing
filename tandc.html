            according to test results under normal usage conditions. Actual wireless transmission rate, wireless
            coverage, and number of connected devices are not guaranteed, and will vary as a result of 1) environmental
            factors, including building materials, physical objects and obstacles, 2) network conditions, including
            local interference, volume and density of traffic, product location, network complexity, and network
            overhead and 3) client limitations, including rated performance, location, connection quality, and client
